# Exhaustive Search
Practical Assignment of the Advanced Algorithms course of the Masters in Informatics Engineering of the University of Aveiro.

### Main Goal
Determine the (one) independent set of maximum cardinality vertices of a given non-oriented graph G, with n vertices and m edges. A subset of the G vertices is said to be an independent set of the G vertices if between any two distinct vertices of the set there is no edge in G.

### Steps:
Develop and test an exhaustive search algorithm to solve the problem. <br>
Analyze the computational effort made by the developed algorithm. For this it must:
- Analyze the complexity of the algorithm.
- Perform a sequence of tests with successively larger instances of the problem. And register and analyze: (1) the number of basic operations performed, (2) the execution time and (3) the number of solutions / configurations tested.
- Compare the results obtained in the two previous steps.
- Estimate the required execution time for much larger problem instances.
- Produce a summarized report.
